### What are sets in python and how they're different from lists?

- In Python, sets are unordered collections of unique elements. This means that the order of elements in a set is not guaranteed to be the same every time you access it. On the other hand, lists are ordered collections of elements, which means that the order of elements in a list is preserved.

- The main difference between a list and a set in Python is that lists allow duplicate elements while sets do not. Additionally, lists are ordered while sets are unordered. This means that you can access elements in a list using their index, but you cannot do this with a set.
